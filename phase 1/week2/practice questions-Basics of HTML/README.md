Practice Questions - Basics of HTML

1. Build your first HTML page. Please follow the following steps:
    1.1. Go to your “Evangadi” folder that you created on your Desktop last week.
    Note: “Evangadi” folder will be where you will save ALL your Evangadi
    course related documents and projects from now on
    1.2. In your “Evangadi” folder, create a folder called "FirstProject"
    1.3. In your “FirstProject” folder, create another folder called "images"
    1.4. Download any 2 images from the internet and save these images inside the
    "images" folder. Rename the images to “imageOne” and “imageTwo”.
    Note: Please keep the image extensions as they are.
    1.5. In your "FirstProject" folder, create an HTML file called
    "imagepractice.html". Add the HTML boilerplate (initial HTML tags) in
    your “imagepractice.html”
    1.6. In your “imagepractice.html”, give the html document a title of "Image
    Practice" and a heading of "My First HTML Document"
    1.7. Add one <h2> tag that says, “First Image” and another <h2> tag that says
    “Second Image”
    1.8. Right under the headings, include the images respectively
    1.9. Open your HTML file in your browser and make sure everything is
    working. Note: Please refer to your class note, section 2.5, to revise the
    steps to create an HTML page

2. Recreate Apple's terms and policy page.
    ● Here is the link to the original page you will recreate
    ○ https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/terms/site.html
    ● Note: Don’t worry about the headers, footers and any styling/formating.
    Those will be covered when we get to CSS
3. Recreate the CommonHtmlTags.html page found on Evangadi website.
Please follow the steps below:
    3.1. Create a folder called “htmlProject” in your “Evangadi” folder
    3.2. Inside your “htmlProject” folder, create two folders called “Resources”
    and “myProject”
    3.3. Download the following zipped file, extract it and save it under your
    “Resources” folder. This folder contains an HTML file
    (“commonHTMLtagsInUse.html) and an image folder (“images”) that
    you will use as reference for your project

    HtmlTagsInUse-updated.zip
    3.4. Inside the ““myProject”” folder, create a new HTML file called,
    “myHtmlTags.html”. This is the file where you will write your HTML
    code
    3.5. Create a folder called “myImages” under the ““myProject” folder. This is
    where you save the images you need for your project. Copy all the images
    from the “Resources” folder and paste them under the “myImages” folder
    3.6. Now, open the “htmlProject” folder with VSC
    3.7. Open the HTML file called, “commonHTMLtagsInUse.html” from the
    “Resources” folder
    3.8. By referring to the “commonHTMLtagsInUse.html” file, rewrite every
tag in your “myHtmlTags.html” file
● DO NOT just copy and paste the code. You must type the entire
HTML code by yourself as that is the best way to learn how to code
● Make sure you fully understand how to link images properly
● Note:Always test every single line of code you write. Open it on
your browser and check if it is working right. DO NOT proceed to
the next step if your code is not showing the expected result. Fix the
problem before heading to the next step.
● Note: Please seek help from your group whenever you have issues.
If your question is beyond your group’s capacity, bring your question
to your instructors when you meet in groups
● HAPPY CODING 😀
